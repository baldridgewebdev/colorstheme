# Colors

A splash of color in an otherwise grey world.  This is a custom theme for my own personal uses, but if you found it and enjoyed it feel free to use it.  Nothing too fancy just a basic theme.

## Features

* built on the back of the barebones theme.  Thanks Benchmark, y'all are cool.

## Installation
